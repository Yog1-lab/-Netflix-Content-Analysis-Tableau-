# -Netflix-Content-Analysis-Tableau-

ðŸ“Š Just wrapped up my first Tableau project!
I used a Netflix dataset to explore and analyze content trends â€” from release patterns to genre distributions and more. It was interesting to see what the data revealed.
This is my first hands-on project in Tableau, and Iâ€™m pretty excited about how it turned out. Iâ€™ve shared a quick walkthrough of the dashboard in the video below.
Would love to hear your thoughts and any feedback you might have!
